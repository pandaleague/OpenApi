/**
 * The Link object represents a possible design-time link for a response. The presence of a link does not guarantee the
 * caller's ability to successfully invoke it, rather it provides a known relationship and traversal mechanism between
 * responses and other operations.
 *
 * Unlike dynamic links (i.e. links provided in the response payload), the OAS linking mechanism does not require link
 * information in the runtime response.
 *
 * For computing links, and providing instructions to execute them, a runtime expression is used for accessing values
 * in an operation and using them as parameters while invoking the linked operation.
